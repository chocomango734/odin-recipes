# odin-recipes
This project is a recipe website made in correlation with the Odin Project and recipes from allrecipes.com.

This website was created using HTML through VirtualStudio Code to display recipes. Each recipe has an image, description, and unordered and ordered lists listing the ingredients and the directions. Recipes are linked on the Odin Recipe homepage in an unordered list and open in a new tab when clicked.
