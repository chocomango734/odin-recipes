    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These egg noodles are the old-fashioned type, just like Grammy 
        used to make! Try them next time you prepare your favorite soup 
        or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks much quicker than 
        dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your electric mixer 
        or your hands to knead the pasta dough.</p>
